# cryptor

Hello everyone,

I'm very proud to share with you a modest application i have made recently called Cryptor.As the impression the name gives, it is an application that secure any file by creating a crypted file (.cr extension file) inspired from the password the user have chosen. I hope you appreciate it.
The application is shared the first time in this link: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6471397156392697856/

Any suggestions are welcome to improve it

Target OS: Windows
